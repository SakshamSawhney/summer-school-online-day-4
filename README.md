  - A normal function `add(a, b)`
  - A function expression for squaring a number
  - An arrow function to greet a user
- All function results are logged to the console.

### ✅ 6. Callback Practice
- Demonstrates the use of a callback function by passing a number to a function that doubles it.

### 🏁 BONUS: Mini Calculator
